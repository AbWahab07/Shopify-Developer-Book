      <h2 id='and_youre_wondering_about_clients'>And You&#8217;re Wondering About Clients?</h2>

<p>It is a good thing to wonder about your clients. The amazing thing about hanging out your shingle as a Shopify developer is the sheer unbridled variety of clients you will meet. If you are like me and enjoy sticking pins in maps, working on Shopify will probably force you to buy a Costco sized box of pins for your world map. Like Ham Radio operators of yesteryear, collecting countries, and cities is in and of itself a perk of the job.</p>

<p>Before corporations knew about the Internet, when cocaine and limos still ran the music industry and Newspapers and Magazines made money, there was little to no public e-commerce. Goods and Services, check. Amazon orders with next-day FedEx deliveries to your door? Not a chance. As Nortel sacrificed itself on the alter of greed laying fiber pipe and higher speed networking machines for the goldrush E-Commerce was rising to be the star it is today. Now, everyone wants in, and Shopify is a wonderful platform to begin with.</p>

<p>What some clients do understand is that while Shopify does not try to offer everything to everybody, what it does offer is sufficient for most needs and purposes. There are plenty of clients that will approach Shopify with pre-conceived notions of what they need in an e-commerce platform and when you tell them Shopify does not support their needs directly, they pop off like bottle rockets and rant. I enjoy these little conflicts. It gives me an opportunity to argue from both sides of the fence.</p>

<p>Some examples of very common rants I hear all the time.</p>

<ul>
<li>Shopify can&#8217;t do one page checkout, oh my god that sucks!</li>

<li>I can&#8217;t pre-program the Discount Code! Gah! That&#8217;s terrible!</li>

<li>I can&#8217;t just change the price by 10% when they order 2 or more? What the hell is that?</li>

<li>It&#8217;s not bilingual? What kind of crap is that? I have to setup two shop? Tabernouche!</li>
</ul>

<p>After six years or so, I am sure Shopify support is pretty tired of hearing the complaints too, but interestingly enough, as that time has passed, the platform has not only grown in capabilities, but it has shown a certain amount of resilience too, as it has absorbed ideas from the public and rolled-out new features. There is a bit of method to the madness.</p>

<p>One of my latest favorite ways to explain to clients why they cannot have the cookies and milk instantly, is short story about the history of one of my favorite programming languages, namely Javascript. It was created by a programmer with lots of experience at developing languages in a mere 10 days. Today, it is on virtually every smartphone in existence, every iPad and all web browsers. It is the ligua franca of the Internet. And for all it&#8217;s flaws from day one, it remains much the same today a decade later. You cannot put the genie back in the bottle. Shopify cannot undo the patterns they laid down six years ago either. Software is mankinds most fiendishly difficult construct ever and so we go with what works, for as long as possible before we dare to change it, especially when it is working.</p>

<p>If a client complains about checkout, I think it is fair to ask them where they get their data supporting their case that one page checkouts convert better than multipage checkouts. Are there enough Ph.D dissertations awarded clearly showing that? Discount Codes are another funny trend these days. As Groupon and Living Social have shown, handing people coupons is good for business. Maybe not for Groupon itself or for the vendors that try it and get swamped by large volumes of orders forcing them to take tiny margins followed by fallow times. Do coupon clippers repeat? Gimmicks?</p>

<p>In Shopify, a Product has no price. A Product&#8217;s Variant has a price though. If you set a price on a Variant, you cannot change it willy nilly at any point in a checkout. You cannot make it bigger or smaller. You may want to, but you cannot do it. It often comes up that clients will want to bundle products together and if someone buys the bundle, it should be cheaper! And yes! I believe! I am on my knees, looking up to the skies and believing! Thing is, Shopify does not work that way. If I bundle three Products that cost $10 each together, when they go in the cart, they cost $10 each, and the bundle of them costs $30. It cannot be $25 just because. Some clients shake their heads at this.</p>

<p>My ideal client will understand my points here&#8230; and want me to ensure their site works like this&#8230;</p>

<p>I want to buy something off the Internet. I am prepared to part with my hard-earned Paypal balance or heck, even add to my Visa/Mastercard debt for it. I am willing to wait a week for it to arrive at my door. I start with the search engine. Does what I want even exist for sale? If it is for sale is there an online source for it in my country? Amazing how Amazon messes this up for me. I have credit at Amazon.com I cannot use at Amazon.ca. I want something from Amazon, but only Amazon.com where I have credit sells it. I put it in my cart, but at checkout they warn me I cannot buy that product. No explanation, just a no. So I am off Amazon and looking at smaller sources. Here is where Shopify comes in. Or the they shall not be named others.</p>

<p>If I find it at a boutique shop, I expect the process to remain pretty simple. I want it. Give it to me. Take my money. Thanks! If I want to game the system, can I find a coupon to save some dollars with? Of course! With Lenovo, it used to be pretty easy to order something and find a coupon for a decent discount. Not sure they like that.</p>

<p>Point is I like clients that are more concerned with their Products being found in the first place than those worried about offering coupons.</p>
