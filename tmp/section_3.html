      <h2 id='shopify_developer_tools'>Shopify Developer Tools</h2>

<p>As an engineer and software developer with some experience, over the years I have coded for many processors in many languages. From Z-80 Assembly language on the TRS-80&#8217;s Zilog Z-80 8-bit CPU, through 6502, 6800 and 68000 chips, to Amiga 500, Sun Workstation C++ and then to PHP, Ruby and Javascript on homebrew Pentiums, the tools coders use day to day have not varied much. These days coding complex web applications on a laptop in a cafe is normal and having great code environments and tools is a welcome change. For those that want to try developing a Shopify App or build out a nice theme for a shop all you need is an inexpensive laptop with wireless Internet and the desire to learn the details of Internet computing.</p>

<h3 id='the_text_editor'>The Text Editor</h3>

<p>Vim, Emacs, TextMate, UltraEdit, Sublime Text 2, Coda, Eclipse, Visual Studio, Notepad and the list goes on. Choosing a text editor is a very personal choice and as I cannot touch type I can offer no wisdom of choice. I love Sublime Text 2 though. I merely get by with my horrid typing skills in the sense that I type at about the same speed as I think. Maybe I think slow and my typing matches that speed? I am not sure. I have never been tested. I am amazed when I see people writing code as they stare out the window at the coffee shop and I wish I could do that too. If I was hiring a coder I would judge their typing skills in the sense that if they cannot really type, then they cannot be a real coder. I am guessing that puts me pretty close to the bread line! At a recent Hadoop Hackathon I attended, the local administrative guru literally flew faster through command line and vim commands then I have ever witnessed before or since. Simply amazing the capacity some people have for that. A text editor has to <em>syntax highlight</em> Ruby, Javascript, Liquid, Haml and Sass and other languages, has to <em>autosave</em> all my code changes whenever I stop coding and switch tasks and it&#8217;s pretty much a sure thing it will need to be able to accept scripts to speed up development.</p>

<h3 id='the_web_browser'>The Web Browser</h3>

<p>Obviously every developer needs a good web browser to work with, one that provides decent tools for examining the results of Shopify theme tweaks or interactions with web applications. All the major browsers these days are suitable however each brings certain quirks to the table. My favorite is currently Chrome. The developer tools are decent. Safari and Firefox offer decent alternatives to Chrome.</p>

<h3 id='versioning_your_work'>Versioning Your Work</h3>

<p>Shopify will version templates as you change them. This built-in versioning system is not terribly useful for a team and certainly is not something you want to rely on for your only theme backup choice. I highly suggest learning a distributed version control system (DVCS) like <em>git</em>. Becoming even a beginner with the <em>git</em> system is a basic skill every developer should have that will payoff in spades. With git you can version <em>everything you work on</em>. Every line of code, every proposal, even binary work like images and assets that you might not ordinarily think of as something that should be under version control. Plus, almost all the coolest open source projects are available using git and there is a serious community of developers all working and sharing code with git.</p>

<h3 id='dropbox'>Dropbox</h3>

<p>Dropbox is great way to cheaply share files and serves well for a workflow between small teams and clients. You can toss files into Dropbox and speed communications along and it beats managing large attachments in email. It has reasonable security most of the time too.</p>

<h3 id='skitch'>Skitch</h3>

<p>Often I will take a screenshot and mark it up with Skitch and then share the resulting image with a client. It is fun to log in to your online accounting package, dig out the invoice you sent to the client 2 months ago, Skitch the timestamped entry showing they logged in and acknowledged the invoice, and fire that image off to them. The mumbled excuses and apologies from their embarassment as you call them out for skipping their obligatory payment for services rendered is a little salve or tonic along the way. Remarkably some clients are oblivious to their obligations and these are the ones to watch out for. The ones that agree to your best estimates to get them most of the way there, and when you finally deliver they come up with a new list of things they insist were there all along and agreed to. Best to keep notes, printed and dates copies of agreements and to watch out for constantly changing requests.</p>

<h3 id='instant_messaging'>Instant Messaging</h3>

<p>You have to use Skype, Adium, Pidgin, iChat or some other service to work with clients. Email does not cut it when you want to really rip through a work session with a client and bounce thoughts and ideas of off them. Screen sharing is one of the quickest ways to teach a client about what your App does, what the shiny buttons they can press do, and the easily overlooked luxuries you&#8217;ve provided them just because you can. Writing a manual for an App is fine too but that takes many hours and in the end, the second you finish that manual it is full of errors or at least erroneous screen shots, descriptions and information as web apps can evolve in near real-time, even after they have been &#8220;delivered&#8221;. I often re-factor my code just because I feel like it (and certainly not because v0.9 is embarrassing, although it might be).</p>

<h3 id='terminal_mode_or_commandline_thinking'>Terminal Mode or Command-Line Thinking</h3>

<p>To make working on Shopify themes easier, Shopify has a command-line (CLI) utility available that can be installed on any computer with the Ruby scripting language installed on it. The utility provides a few basic commands that allow you to easily download an entire shop for editing. You can then immediately check the entire shop codebase into a version control system like git. The next step is to tell the computer to watch for any changes in the theme files. If a change is detected like adding a collection title to a template or a for loop is added to render some navigation links in a menu, you want those changes automatically sent to the shop. That way, you can simply refresh your browser and see the changes you just made. Even better, there is a development tool called Live Reload that will auto-refresh your browser whenever changes are detected to the code that is currently being rendered in the browser, meaning you can edit your Shopify theme or App, and simply switch focus to your browser to see the results without doing much more than a single keystroke combination. As a developer learning to use the command line with skill and knowing how the operating system utilities help is essential.</p>

<h3 id='localhost_development_on_a_laptop_desktop_or_other_devices'>Localhost Development on a Laptop, Desktop or Other Devices</h3>

<p>With text editing, version control, and a web browser, a developer is ready to tackle almost any kind of Shopify project. To develop an application that can be hooked up to a Shopify shop it will be imperative to be able to develop the application on your local machine. In the early days of web application development one had to ensure there was a web server like Apache available in addition to scripting languages like Ruby, Python and PHP. That extra level of hassle we do without since Ruby provides several extremely fast web servers that make local development a breeze. A great example is the <em>thin</em> webserver by Marc-Andre Courneyer. Other options exist like Pow from 37Signals, WebBrick, Mongrel, Nginx, etc. Testing a script out on a new concept or idea or running an entire App should not tied to a server on the Internet. Being able to develop localhost when offline is crucial.</p>

<h3 id='precompiled_css'>Pre-Compiled CSS</h3>

<p>A final tool for the Shopify developer that I think deserves more attention is the use of compiled CSS through the use of Less or Sass. Less can be compiled with Javascript and Sass is compiled with Ruby. The advantages are somewhat spectacular in my opinion. You can build a complex Shopify theme using these tools and gain a lot of very important flexibility. A client can change one value in their shop and the change propagates throughout the CSS easily when you use Less or Sass. Working stylesheets by hand is clearly the least efficient methodology especially when a developer does have a good understanding of how CSS works.</p>
