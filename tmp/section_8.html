      <h2 id='the_shopify_api'>The Shopify API</h2>

<p>One of the most interesting features of Internet computing that has evolved since the 1990&#8217;s has been the introduction and growth of service oriented companies that work strictly using Internet protocols. YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Shopify and multitudes of other companies that run from modest brick and mortar headquarters, have relatively small employee head counts but count millions and perhaps billions of people as users of their services. Little of their success can be attributed to pounding the pavment door to door, or by flooding the TV with advertising. Service oriented companies leverage the Internet itself for their growth and one of the underlying reasons for their rapid growth, adoption and success is due the concept of the API or Application Programming Interface.</p>

<p>What better way to introduce the public at large to your service than to allow them to build it, populate it and enjoy it using their own labour and tools. YouTube, Facebook and Twitter would not exist without user generated content. How to ensure everyone can contribute to your service without being overly technical or specialized? How to accept a video from an iPhone or Android phone, an iPad or Galaxy Tablet, a Mac or a PC? The key is the use and promotion of an API. Provide a simple mechanism everyone can take advantage of and the ball starts rolling.</p>

<p>Shopify released their API after some years of processing a steadily growing number of transactions (perhaps some would see it as explosive growth). A period of time during which Shopify surely learned not only to understand the intimate details of what happens when millions of dollars flow through Internet cash registers, but also the huge number of possibilities and limitations that can be faced by a codebase. Once the early established shops crossed the chasm from early adopters to profitable e-commerce enterprises, there was a corresponding demand for more and better control of the underlying processes.</p>

<p>Shopify chose to establish their API using the software architecture known as <strong>RE</strong>presentational <strong>S</strong>tate <strong>T</strong>ransfer (REST) accepted by a majority of the Internet community. The API provides support for accessing a Shopify shop and creating, reading, updating or deleting the resources of the shop. Almost all e-commerce companies offer some sort of API but there is a clearly a difference in the degree of maturity and the amount of thought that has gone into some of them. The Shopify API is proving to be very helpful in advancing the capabilities of many thousands of shops. Whenever the general question is asked &#8220;Can Shopify do such and such?&#8221;, I am often answering the question with a confident &#8220;Yes it can, you simply need to use the API.&#8221;</p>

<p>If we accept that software is one of the most fiendishly diffcult man-made constructs invented and if we accept that even after nearly seventy years of computing research and development we are still stumbling along like drunk sailors, we must learn to accept and set limits while we sort it all out. Shopify has established a working e-commerce system transacting hundreds of millions of dollars per year for many thousands of merchants, but it cannot stray too far from the model that currently works. If all the many requested features were added, the system would likely become unstable and prone to outages, breakdowns and a destroyed reputation for reliability. We know some of the most expensive human mistakes ever can be attributed to computer bugs no one ever knew were there till it was too late. By offering an API built around a core set of resources Shopify has enabled an ecosystem of App developers to come together and create unique and necessary offerings to make running an e-commerce shop on the Shopify platform easier for merchants.</p>

<p>A good example would be the task of fulfilling an order. Shopify has a setup option allowing a merchant to select from a few fulfillment companies. What happens when you check out that short list and you do not see your option? Your supply chain from Manufacturer DrubbleZook to warehouse Zingoblork with shipper USPS or Royal Mail is simply not there. But you know every single order can be sent to an App. You know you can select up to 250 orders at once and send them all to an App. So surely an App can be built to handle the fulfillment. An App running in the cloud listening 24/7 for incoming orders. And when it gets an order it robotically follows a set of instructions that ensures the Shopify merchant is going to be happy. The App takes the order apart and inspects it. The App knows where each line item is to be sent. It knows the ID of every variant, and whether a discount code was used. It knows the credit cart issuer. The App can take the order from Shopify and format it for Zingoblork and their special needs. It is 2012 as I write this and Zingoblork warehouse runs off of any of the following data exchange mechanisms:</p>

<ul>
<li>a Microsoft DOS server, connected to the Internet by FTP. They only accept CSV files via FTP</li>

<li>a Microsoft NT Server, connected to the Internet by sFTP. They only accept CSV files via sFTP</li>

<li>email. The company can only deal with email. They have been around forty years, and it&#8217;s all email all the time</li>

<li>HTTP POST. A modern miracle! A warehouse fulfillment company that actually has IT!</li>

<li>EDI which we won&#8217;t even bother to describe, but suffice it to say, the Chevy Vega of exchanges</li>

<li>SOAP which makes me want to run away and mow grass for a living</li>
</ul>

<p>The App accepts all orders thanks to the API and perhaps in combination with WebHooks it processes them and sends them off to the fulfillment company. Once the fulfillment company has accepted the order(s) and sent them off to their final destination as a delivery, the person that bought the goods needs to know. Some companies will collect all the orders they process for a shop and create a daily manifest of tracking codes assigned to the orders and place those in a holding pen accessible only by a special FTP account. Others will simply send these codes to the shop via email completely destroying the shop keepers email inbox and sanity. The best fulfillment companies will use HTTP POST to send the order with a tracking number back to the App allowing the App to automatically create a fulfillment using the API with the tracking code. Shopify automatically detects the creation of a new fulfillment and sends an appropriate email. This is wonderful since the App and the API together can close the loop automatically.</p>

<p>Without an API it would be impossible to offer this level of customization to a shop. Another interesting use of Shopify is when a shop is opened up to sell products on a consignment basis. If I accept 1000 of your widgets to sell in my shop for $20 each you want to know if you have made $20 in sales or $400 in sales or even $4000 in sales. If I accept 1000 widgets to sell on behalf of 20 or 30 different vendors my life will almost certainly be miserable unless I use the API. I record each and every line item sold as a sale assigned to the product&#8217;s vendor. Every product has a selling price and a cost price and so we know the difference between those should be the profit to split between me and my vendor(s). I have a deal with my vendors giving them 80/20 or sometimes 60/40 splits of that profit. We really should assign that percentage to each sale as well so that we can make different deals depending on the day of the week, the colour of the sky or the popularity of the product at the checkout. That is an App that can be plugged into a shop. None of that is possible without an App.</p>

<p>The presence and functionality of the Shopify API is a crucial variable in the decision equation most enterprises work out before going into business with the Shopify platform. If a business knows the fixed costs to run a shop for a year are $1000 and that their theme will cost them $5000 to make the shop attractive, the API is the only other key option that deserves close attention. Adding an App can add monthly or one-time fees, but they can also save hundreds of hours in manual labour. Paying for a custom App to be developed to address a special need can cost a few thousand dollars but can result in measurable growth in sales. Many companies are looking for a reliable hosted e-commerce platform and partner(s) to work with to bring their e-commerce vision to life. Knowing they can use the API to add the little extras is often enough incentive to choose Shopify over competing platforms.</p>
