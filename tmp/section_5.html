      <h2 id='and_youre_wondering_about_clients'>And You&#8217;re Wondering About Clients?</h2>

<p>It is a good thing to wonder about your clients. The amazing thing about hanging out your shingle as a Shopify developer is the sheer unbridled variety of clients you will meet. If you are like me and enjoy sticking pins in maps, working on Shopify will probably force you to buy a Costco sized box of pins for your world map. Like the Ham Radio operators of yesteryear, collecting shops from far off countries and cities to work on is neat. I still have no hits from Easter Island but I am holding out hope.</p>

<p>Before corporations knew about the Internet, when cocaine and limos still ran the music industry and newspapers and magazines actually made money, there was little or no online e-commerce. Amazon orders for books and cake decorating tools with next-day delivery to your door? Not a chance back then, a mere decade ago. As Nortel sacrificed itself on the alter of greed laying fiber p\ipes and high speed machines for the coming Internet goldrush age, e-commerce was just a pale shade of what it is today. Now, <em>everyone</em> wants in and Shopify is a handy platform for many young businesses to try.</p>

<p>Some clients understand that while Shopify does not try to offer everything to everybody, what it does offer is sufficient for most of their immediate needs. There are also plenty of clients that approach Shopify with notions of what they <em>think</em> they need and so when you tell them Shopify does not support their needs, they pop off like bottle rockets and rant. I enjoy these little conflicts. It gives me an opportunity to argue from both sides of the fence. Some of them make a good case and I feel bad that they cannot realistically use Shopify without sacrificing something fundamental. Internationalization is one of those issues. Many shops need to serve their public in more than one language and Shopify does not work in more than one language with the same shop. Even if a shop is presented with a deal on a second shop there is a lot of work in trying run two shops instead of just one.</p>

<p>Some other examples of very common rants I hear:</p>

<ul>
<li>Shopify can&#8217;t do one page checkout, oh my god that sucks!</li>

<li>I can&#8217;t pre-program the Discount Code! Gah! That&#8217;s terrible!</li>

<li>I can&#8217;t just change the price by 10% when they order 2 or more? What the hell is that?</li>
</ul>

<p>After six years or so, I am sure Shopify support staff are also pretty tired of hearing the same complaints. As time has passed the platform has not only grown and extended in capabilities but it has shown a certain amount of resilience too. Faced with the choice of trying to do much or just doing what it does do well, Shopify has embraced the idea of just doing what it does well.</p>

<h3 id='clients_respond_to_clear_explanations'>Clients Respond to Clear Explanations</h3>

<p>One of my favorite ways of explaining to clients why they cannot have Shopify just change on a dime is the story about Javascript, the lingua franca of all web browsers. It was created by a programmer with lots of experience at developing languages in about 10 days. Today it is part of every smartphone, every iPad tablet and all desktop web browsers. For all it&#8217;s flaws from day one it remains much the same today, a whole decade later. Turns out you cannot put the genie back in the bottle and so Shopify cannot undo the patterns laid down six years ago either. Software is probably mankind&#8217;s most fiendishly difficult invention and so we have little choice but to go with what works for as long as possible. We do not want to tinker with a working formula. Right Coke? When they changed their formula they had their butts handed to them on a platter.</p>

<p>If a client complains about checkout, I think it is fair to ask them where they get their data supporting their case that one page checkouts convert better than multi-page checkouts. Are there enough Ph.D dissertations awarded that clearly show that as a certainty? Discount codes are another interesting trend these days. As Groupon and Living Social have demonstrated handing out coupons to people can be really good for increasing business. I am content to ignore discount coupons for the moment although I did come up a great App that makes my clients very happy. When reviewing an order where the client is not a happy camper I place a link on the order details screen that sends a nice apology letter to the client with a nice discount code attached. Works like a charm.</p>

<h3 id='i_want_variable_pricing'>I Want Variable Pricing</h3>

<p>In Shopify, a product has no price. Only a product&#8217;s variants have a price. If you set a price on a variant you cannot change it willy nilly at any point in a session. You cannot make it bigger or smaller. You may want to but you cannot do it. It often comes up that clients will want to bundle products together and if someone buys entire the bundle, it should be cheaper for the products. And yes I believe that, in fact I am on my knees looking up at the sky right now and I am believing that! The thing is Shopify does not work that way. If I bundle three products that cost $10 each together when they go in the cart they still cost $10 each. The bundle costs $30. It cannot be $25 just because. Some clients shake their heads at this. There are of course ways to sell bundles cheaper, but that involves actually making them separate products.</p>

<p>The <em>ideal client</em> will understand that e-commerce and opening a shop is a tough business. My ideal shopper is me. In my shoes I want to buy something off the Internet. I am prepared to part with my hard earned Paypal balance or even add to my Visa debt for what I need. I am willing to wait a week for it to arrive at my door. I start with the search engine. Does what I want even exist for sale? If it is for sale is there an online source for it in my country? It is amazing how Amazon messes this simple need up. I have credits at Amazon.com but I cannot use them with Amazon.ca. I want to buy something from Amazon but only Amazon.com sells what I want. I put it in my cart but at checkout they warn me I cannot buy what I want. No explanation just a No. So now I am browsing for Shopify or other small e-commerce retailers for what I want.</p>

<p>If I find what I want at a smaller shop than Amazon I still expect the buying process to be simple. I want that thing. Please send it to me now! Take my money. Thanks! The point is I like clients that are more concerned with their products being found in the first place than those worried about offering coupons.</p>
