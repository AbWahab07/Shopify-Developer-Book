      <h2 id='common_questions'>Common Questions</h2>

<p>There are plenty of reasons to choose a <em>hosted</em> platform like Shopify as the responsibility for the necessary implementation details of ensuring your shop&#8217;s site is reachable by the public is purely Shopify&#8217;s responsibility. By offering a platform that provides most of the basic features needed to run an e-commerce website Shopify has created a thriving community of shops that sells soup to nuts. It can be comforting to know that when an issue arises with respect to how to configure a shop that there are other people that have faced the same issue before and likely solved it.</p>

<h3 id='how_to_capture_that_extra_information'>How to Capture that Extra Information</h3>

<p>One of the earliest and still most common questions is about how to capture custom information for products. There are thousands of shops that need to collect custom information. Glass baby bottles etched with a monogram, handbags with initials stitched into the leather, silver pendant jewelry with the name of the family dog or the newest twins on the block, the presentation of a form to collect this information is seemingly a source of endless discussion.</p>

<p>With the introduction of cart attributes it became possible but not necessarily simple to pass extra data through checkout with the order. The cart attributes are a simple key:value pair where a key is used to refer to some value. An order can have as many of these attributes to fully define needed product customization for an order. A typical key might be the identification number of a product. The value that can be stored with the key is usually a string of text. The following code present a simple key and value.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre>attribute[&#39;I_am_a_key&#39;] = &quot;welcome to outer space astronaut!&quot;

attribute[12345678] = &quot;David Bowie&quot;

attribute[44556677] = &#39;[{name: &quot;qbf&quot;, action: &quot;jtld&quot;}, {name: &quot;lh&quot;, action: &quot;lnot&quot;}]
</pre>
</div>
<p>Those are three examples of setting a key to a value. Using Javascript it is possible to experiment by setting a cart attribute and then checking that it was set correctly. Web browsers all provide Javascript and Javascript represents data and objects in a format called JSON. One excellent fact about this is that JSON can be stored as a text string and that means we can create complex data structures and save them as attributes! The third example I present shows this. The cart attribute for ID 44556677 has been assigned a string of JSON. This is extremely handy in a web application like Shopify. That value could be read as &#8220;There are TWO 44556677 variants in the cart, one is named <em>qbf</em> and the other <em>jtld</em>&#8221;. When rendering the cart to shoppers, it&#8217;s possible to show these values in the appropriate line items along with the variants. The checked out order will display the same keys and values.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre>44556677: &#39;[{name: &quot;qbf&quot;, action: &quot;jtld&quot;}, {name: &quot;lh&quot;, action: &quot;lneg&quot;}]
</pre>
</div>
<p>The previous script presented is a little confusing perhaps and some shop keepers might balk at having the customization information collected looking like that. It is possible to deal with this issue by approaching the issue with more sophistication. Instead of directly storing the customization data in cart attributes, they could be stored in a cookie, or in the web browsers built-in localStorage. During the creation and subsequent editing of a specific shopping session the custom code manages the customization information as JSON but before submitting the order to checkout the code translates the JSON to plain english that would be set as the values in the cart attributes. As an example, if my variant represented a Farm Animal, for $24.00, I could rewrite the attribute to be</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre>attribute[&quot;farm_animal&quot;] = &quot;Name: QBF, Action: JTLD, Name: LH, Action: LNOT&quot;
</pre>
</div>
<p>That is a little more readable and could be interpreted by the Shop owner with little difficulty.</p>

<p>One important aspect of customization that should be addressed is that flexibility like this comes with a certain cost. While it does imply that you collect extra information for a Product, you can lose certain Shopify functionality when you use it. For example, if you have the need to customize a product with four options, Shopify only has three. So you decide to collect the fourth option with a form field, and use the built-in options for the other three. When you make this choice, you lose the ability to keep track of inventory based on that fourth option. If that does not matter, then it is obviously not a problem. I often tell people that if price changes are involved, they have no choice but to use the built in options to customize variants. This costs them SKU&#8217;s and there is a limit of up to 100 customized variants. A virtually unlimited amount of further customization is possible, but it should be applied to options that have no inherent cost or affect on inventory management.</p>

<h3 id='image_switching'>Image Switching</h3>

<p>Shopify organizes a product by assigning it attributes like vendor, type and description. A product has no price per se but it does have variants, and each variant of which there has to be at least one has the price. A product also has images. If we think about this knowing just these facts it is clear that if we upload many images for a product then we may have many images uploaded for the product, but there is no connection to the variants!</p>

<p>If a shop is presenting a product that comes in five colours, or perhaps seven differing kinds of fabrics then it is likely they will want to change the main image presented to shopper to match the currently selected option. If I am looking at a t-shirt and I select the colour blue for it, I would expect the t-shirt to change to be blue. Some of my earliest customization jobs were all about providing this to shops. Wall Glamour in the UKlamour&#8221;) is a simple example of this. When choosing any kind of wall stickers, you can click a colour palette and the main image changes to match.</p>

<p>The vexing issue has always been that if you have 20 variants and 20 images uploaded, how do you connect them together? Recently Shopify introduced <em>alt</em> tag editing for uploaded images allowing a simple bit of text to be saved with uploaded images. Not only is this good for SEO but it can be used as a rudimentary hook so that when variants are selected, the image alt tags can be searched for a match, and an image swap can occur. I have never had trouble with more sophisticated approaches involving naming the images according to a variant key like SKU or title and using regular expressions, but for novices the Shopify alt tag approach is pretty good. You sacrifice SEO results for images, but you gain nicer shop presentation when images match the selected variants.</p>

<p>One cool aspect of swapping images is that all the images are readily available from Liquid when you pass the product through the built-in Liquid filter <em>json</em>. Any Javascript code can thus grab any image and process it as needed. By that I mean you can tack on an <em>grande for the Grande size image, or</em>thumb or any other image size designation and have that image for use on the page. Once the Liquid phase of rendering a product is done it can be left to Javascript to support image swaps with nice effects like fades and other easing motions.</p>

<h3 id='jsonp'>JSONP</h3>

<p>Most developers that have done any Javascript have probably done some asynchronous Javascript programming to. With Shopify being a hosted platform, all shops are known by their staked out subdomain name and the <em>myshopify.com</em> root domain. Even if I use the DNS to fool the world into thinking my shop is found at http://www.young-marble-giants.com it is still and forever http://no-eat-the-blue-mushrooms.myshopify.com for all intents and purposes. If I have a special question I have to ask of an App how can I do that? I could use an HTML <em>iframe</em> element I to embed a form in my shop, or I could use JSONP. That allows me to make a cross-domain Ajax request and so I can render the results of a question asked on the domain http://no-eat-the-blue-mushrooms.myshopify.com but answered by the domain http://veggie-chef.heroku.com. This can be quite useful and serves as a huge support mechanism on more than a couple of sites I have built out for clients. If I wanted to avoid JSONP and just use straight up Ajax I could always create a subdomain like http://fizzbuzz.young-marble-giants.com and therefore I would be operating on the same domain and Ajax would work.</p>

<h3 id='special_invites'>Special Invites</h3>

<p>Before the App store and lockdown Apps like Gatekeeper were available, it was really difficult to open up a Shop and keep it locked down so that only choice guests could shop there. I was asked once to build out a Gatekeeper style solution just around christmas a few years ago. The nervous nelly NYC designer that contacted me was very concerned Shopify could not handle extreme traffic, and he was equally concerned that any App I built for him would crumble under intense load too. I brushed him off since all I knew was that there is no sense is worrying about something that has not happened and for all I knew, his shop would see 20 visits or maybe 200 or maybe even 2000 but all those numbers are small, so why worry.</p>

<p>I built an App that presented a simple form that captured a person&#8217;s email address and a secret code. The code and the WWW address of the App was presented to all the people watching a popular TV show on D-Day. Each person that typed in the correct code had their email address sent to MailChimp and then the App unlocked the password protected Shopify site using the credentials only the App knew. Since the App was on a subdomain of the Shopify domain, the App could set the needed session cookie Shopify created and thus the TV shopper was seemlessly transferred into a locked shop without having to face the password screen. I paid little attention to this whole setup until D-Day around 3:00pm. I logged into the shop admin and was astonished to see close to 13,000 orders booked for that day alone and sales north of $750K. Considering the items for sale were made in China and cost a buck or two each, this was a real eye opener. I learned the lesson that accepting contracts like that without negotiating for a small % of sales is not great business. Both Shopify and my cloud based App never hiccuped during this event and that really gave me a lot of confidence in the platform.</p>
